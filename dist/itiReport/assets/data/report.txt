Message from the CoST Uganda Champion

On 11th April 2024, my Ministry commissioned the second Infrastructure Transparency Index at Golf Course Hotel and appealed to the selected government entities to cooperate and provide the required infrastructure project data to support CoST Uganda in effectively completing the evaluation exercise and producing a report that will mirror our performance.

I am happy to learn that 58 projects from 30 entities have been evaluated in this 2nd Index for which we are launching the report. I particularly congratulate the 30 entities and CoST Uganda on the successful conclusion of the exercise. The evaluation results are based on four key dimensions: enabling environment, capacities and processes, citizen participation, and information disclosure. Whereas there is a slight improvement compared to the first index, the performance still needs to be to the expected standard. Still, as we continue to improve our work based on this kind of empirical evidence, we can score up to 100% in subsequent indices and attain maximum infrastructure transparency.

Uganda's national ITI score increased from 20.8% in 2021 to 32.26% in the 2nd index, indicating progress in promoting infrastructure transparency. Improvements were observed across all dimensions:

1. Enabling environment: from 41.4% (2021) to 43.50% (2024)

2. Capacities and processes: from 13.5% (2021) to 29.78% (2024)

3. Citizen participation: from 13.8% (2021) to 33.65% (2024)

4. Information disclosure: from 18.4% (2021) to 26.81% (2024)

These improvements are encouraging, suggesting that the efforts of CoST Uganda and all stakeholders involved in this process are yielding positive results. Procuring Entities (PEs) appear to be making progress.

The performance of Local Governments in the 2nd Index showed some improvement compared to the 2021 index but remained poor overall. Five out of ten local government entities scored above 15%. In contrast, Central Government entities performed better, with 55% scoring above 25% in disclosure, while 45% scored below 25%.

The Ministry of Works and Transport will continue to provide stewardship to CoST Uganda. In my capacity as the Champion, I congratulate this year’s 2024 index inaugural best three winners KCCA 80.26%), MoWT (60.66%), and Office of the President (55.23%). On the other hand, LGs best three winners are Mpigi DLG (42.29%) followed by Jinja DLG (40.97%) and Kabale DLG (40.27%). Therefore, as we celebrate this performance, we encourage entities to improve on areas where you did not perform well and call upon the other entities to double their efforts in promoting transparency and take over in the subsequent indices.

With the current levels of infrastructure transparency revealed in this second ITI index, I appeal to the respective Government entities, oversight bodies, civil society actors, and the media to take a keen interest in transforming these gaps and strengthening improvement by implementing the recommendations.

vii Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

On behalf of the Government, I would like to express our appreciation to CoST International for providing this tool and the financial support to implement it across government institutions. My Ministry will work with the respective entities and stakeholders to address the issues and recommendations raised in this 2nd index and those that still need to be implemented from the first Index.

I thank you all.

For God and My Country.

Executive Summary

The 2024 Infrastructure Transparency Index (ITI) for Uganda presents a comprehensive assessment of transparency in the country's public infrastructure sector. The ITI, developed by CoST - the Infrastructure Transparency Initiative, evaluates transparency across four key dimensions: enabling environment, capacities and processes, citizen participation, and information disclosure. Each dimension is scored on a scale of 0-100%, with the overall national score being a weighted average of these dimensions.

Findings from the second index revealed that Uganda's national ITI score improved to 32.26% in 2024, up from 20.8% in 2021, indicating progress while highlighting substantial room for improvement.

The Infrastructure Transparency Index (ITI) evaluates transparency across four key dimensions:

1. Enabling Environment (43.50%): Assesses the legal and regulatory framework supporting transparency in the infrastructure sector.

2. Capacities and Processes (29.78%): Evaluates procuring entities' abilities and procedures to implement transparency measures effectively.

3. Citizen Participation (33.65%): Measures opportunities for public engagement and the utilization of disclosed information by citizens.

4. Information Disclosure (26.81%): Examines the actual publication of project-related data throughout the infrastructure project lifecycle.

Each dimension is scored on a scale of 0-100%, with the overall national score being a weighted average of these dimensions. This multifaceted approach provides a comprehensive view of transparency practices in Uganda's infrastructure sector, highlighting both progress and areas needing improvement.

The ITI also measured levels of transparency across 30 entities, revealing that only 3 out of 30 evaluated entities scored above 50%, with Kampala Capital City Authority leading at 80.26%. Across the project lifecycle, the Index revealed a marked decrease in transparency from project identification (64.80%) to implementation stages (Execution contract implementation: 8.82%, Supervision contract implementation: 1.08%).

ix Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

Results from sector variations revealed significant differences, with the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry & Fisheries leading at 51.28% (Agriculture Sector) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives scoring the lowest at 4.99%. (Trade Sector). The most improved entity from first Index is Jinja with Jinja District from 5.76% to 40.97% (+35.21%), a remarkable 611.28% increase.

Through the Index, the results were used to assess compliance and practice with the legal and policy framework for delivering infrastructure projects. The results revealed that, there remains a huge policy practice gap in the sector, while Uganda established a robust regulatory framework, implementation remains a significant challenge. The index also revealed that entities and projects with larger projects tend to achieve a higher transparency score. The results also identified that there are cconsistent patterns across dimensions which indicate that barriers to transparency are systemic rather than isolated. The ITI recommendations include the need for government, through its relevant institutions, to bridgee the implementation gap, enhance digital infrastructure, implement lifecycle transparency, capacity building, and boost citizen engagement.

In conclusion, while Uganda has made progress in infrastructure transparency, significant work remains to create a more open, accountable, and effective infrastructure sector. By addressing the identified gaps and leveraging successful practices can enhance public trust and maximize the impact of infrastructure investments

Chapter 1 | The Infrastructure Transparency Index

1.1 About CoST

The Infrastructure Transparency Initiative (CoST) is a global program dedicated to improving transparency and accountability in public infrastructure. Established in 2012, CoST works collaboratively with governments, private sector entities, and civil society to enhance governance and maximise the value of infrastructure investments.

Key Features of CoST:

● Disclosure is the publication of data from infrastructure projects. Procuring entities disclose forty data points at critical stages throughout the project cycle in accordance with the CoST Infrastructure Data Standard (CoST IDS) and increasingly in the Open Contracting for Infrastructure Data Standard (OC4IDS) format.

● Assurance is an independent review that highlights the accuracy and completeness of the disclosed data and turns it into compelling information that helps communicate issues of concern and areas of good practice.

● Multi-stakeholder working brings together government, the private sector, and civil society in a concerted effort to pursue the common goal of improving transparency, accountability, and performance in the preparing for and providing public infrastructure information. This is typically achieved through a multi-stakeholder group where each stakeholder has an equal voice in leading a CoST programme.

● Social accountability refers to efforts made to ensure that the disclosed data and assurance reports are taken up and used by stakeholders – including civil society, the private sector and government oversight bodies – to strengthen existing accountability mechanisms and prompt appropriate corrective action, not only about specific projects but also more broadly in the sector.

CoST Uganda:

CoST Uganda was launched in April 2014 and relaunched in February 2017 by the Ministry of Works and Transport carrying on from Uganda National Roads Authority to scale up the CoST approach at the national level. It has established itself as a key player in promoting infrastructure transparency in the country. Hosted by the Africa Freedom of Information Centre (AFIC), a civil society organisation.

Throughout its existence, CoST Uganda has achieved several significant milestones. A key accomplishment has been the integration of the Open Contracting for Infrastructure Data Standard (OC4IDS) into the Government Procurement Portal, with ongoing efforts to incorporate it into the e-GP system. This integration demonstrates Uganda's commitment to aligning with global best practices in infrastructure transparency.

2 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

CoST Uganda's work extends beyond project assessment. The CoST Uganda has also made substantial contributions to project oversight and analysis. Published five Assurance reports covering 59 projects across ten high-spend entities, providing valuable insights into the state of infrastructure projects in the country. Additionally, it launched the first Infrastructure Transparency Index (ITI) in 2021, evaluating 60 projects from 30 entities and setting a benchmark for future assessments.

CoST Uganda's journey since 2014 demonstrates a steady progression in institutionalising transparency practices. Integrating international open data standards into national systems indicates a commitment to aligning with global best practices. However, the need for a relaunch in 2017 suggested the need to address initial challenges in implementation of the CoST approach, highlighting the complex nature of establishing transparency initiatives in the infrastructure sector. Despite these challenges, CoST Uganda's consistent efforts and achievements underscore its crucial role in advancing infrastructure transparency.

1.1 Concept

1.1 Concept of the Infrastructure Transparency Index (ITI)

The Infrastructure Transparency Index (ITI) is a comprehensive tool developed by CoST (the Infrastructure Transparency Initiative) to evaluate and monitor transparency levels in public infrastructure projects. It goes beyond traditional access to information metrics, offering a holistic approach to assessing transparency, participation, and accountability in the sector.

Key Features of the ITI:

1. Multi-dimensional Approach: The ITI evaluates four key dimensions: a. Enabling environment b. Capacities and processes c. Citizen participation d. Information disclosure

2. Broad Interpretation of Transparency: The ITI considers access to information and associated enablers and capacities, including citizen participation, that create public value.

3. Scoring Mechanism: The final ITI score is derived from a weighted sum of the four dimensions, allowing for a nuanced assessment of overall transparency.

4. Applicability: While designed for CoST members, the ITI can be used by any interested parties to evaluate and strengthen their institutions.

5. Evidence-Based Reform: By providing data at each stage of the infrastructure project cycle, the ITI helps drive reforms that reduce mismanagement, inefficiency, and corruption.

3 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

Methodology and Design:

● The ITI instrument is based on international good practices and lessons learned, designed collaboratively to ensure relevance and effectiveness.

● It provides a methodology for calculating scores for individual procuring entities, which can be aggregated for national or sub-national assessments.

● The scores reflect the enabling conditions for transparency and the practical application of transparency measures in recent infrastructure projects.

Benefits of the ITI:

● Helps stakeholders understand strengths and weaknesses in transparency mechanisms within the sector.

● Facilitates monitoring of transparency levels over time.

● Contributes to cost savings by identifying inefficiencies and promoting better practices.

● Supports the delivery of higher-quality infrastructure by improving sector performance.

The ITI's multi-dimensional approach recognises that adequate transparency is about information availability and the systems, capacities, and engagement mechanisms that support it. This holistic view allows for a more nuanced understanding of transparency challenges and opportunities in the infrastructure sector, paving the way for targeted improvements and reforms.

1.2 Objectives

The aim of the ITI instrument, as set out in this manual, is to enable the level of transparency and accountability in public infrastructure to be assessed and monitored over time. The objectives are as follows:

● To provide a measure of infrastructure transparency and the capacity to improve transparency among procuring entities.

● to track and encourage progress and facilitate peer learning while helping to hold procuring entities accountable.

● Building on existing data standards such as the CoST IDS and the OC4IDS to raise awareness of transparency at the national and international levels.

● To allow consistent country comparisons at the international level to facilitate peer learning and the identification of common international strengths and weaknesses.

The tool calculates an ITI score (whether national or subnational) on a scale of zero to one hundred (0-100) for a country’s national or subnational public infrastructure and individual

4 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

Procuring Entity (PE) ITI scores for associated PEs. The scores are based on many unique indicators. These are independently evaluated to assess PE practices and the conditions that give rise to transparency and accountability in the local infrastructure sector.

The score is then published as an ITI index that ranks procuring entities. The resulting highlighting and identification of shortcomings in existing practice can then inform the development of an action plan that will help raise transparency and accountability standards within the country or sector and improve ongoing infrastructure management practices.

The ITI results provide information that can guide public leaders, international organisations, procuring entities, and others interested in strengthening infrastructure-related transparency and accountability. Follow-up ITI assessments should occur periodically and consistently while allowing time for reforms to be introduced and take effect between evaluations.

1.3 Principles

1.3 Principles of the Infrastructure Transparency Index (ITI)

The Infrastructure Transparency Index (ITI) is built on key principles guiding its design, implementation, and evolution. These principles ensure the ITI remains a relevant, reliable, and impactful tool for assessing and improving transparency in public infrastructure projects.

Core Principles:

1. Relevance: The ITI focuses on critical aspects of infrastructure transparency, including legal frameworks, institutional capacities, and information disclosure practices. This ensures the index provides meaningful insights that can drive real project management and delivery improvements.

2. Comprehensiveness: By employing a wide range of indicators, the ITI offers a thorough assessment of the sector while allowing for detailed evaluation of individual procuring entities. This multi-layered approach provides a nuanced understanding of transparency at various levels.

3. Simplicity and Trustworthiness: The ITI uses straightforward data collection and analysis methods. This simplicity ensures diverse stakeholders, from government officials to civil society organisations, can easily understand and trust the results.

4. Objectivity and Replicability: The methodology minimises subjectivity and ensures consistent results when replicated. This objectivity is crucial for maintaining the index's credibility over time and across different contexts.

5. Impartiality: An independent third party with relevant expertise oversees the implementation of the ITI, ensuring unbiased assessment and reporting.

6. Periodicity: Regular evaluations, preferably conducted annually, allow for tracking progress and improvements in transparency over time. This periodic nature encourages continuous enhancement of transparency practices.

5 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

7. Accuracy and Specificity: The ITI relies on primary sources of information and avoids data reuse across indicators. This approach ensures that each aspect of transparency is assessed independently and accurately.

8. Adaptability: The ITI is designed to evolve, accommodating an increasing number of assessed entities and undergoing periodic reviews to maintain its relevance and effectiveness.

9. Constructiveness: By facilitating comparisons and monitoring changes over time, the ITI promotes stakeholder collaboration and continuous improvement in transparency practices.

Expected Outcomes:

Through these principles, the ITI aims to:

1. Provide a comprehensive measure of infrastructure transparency across procuring entities.

2. Enable tracking of progress and facilitate learning between entities and countries.

3. Raise awareness about the importance of transparency in infrastructure projects.

4. Allow for meaningful comparisons to identify common challenges and best practices.

The strength of the ITI lies in its balanced approach to measurement and improvement. A standardised yet adaptable tool enables both internal progress tracking and international benchmarking. This dual focus is a powerful motivator for enhancing transparency practices across the infrastructure sector.

However, it's important to note that the ultimate impact of the ITI depends on how decisionmakers use its results. The index provides evidence and insights, but it's up to stakeholders to translate these findings into concrete actions and reforms. As such, the ITI catalyses change, offering a clear picture of where improvements are needed and providing a roadmap for enhancing transparency in public infrastructure projects.

1.4 Structure and Content

The Infrastructure Transparency Index (ITI) is built on a comprehensive framework designed to capture the multifaceted nature of transparency in public infrastructure projects. Its structure allows for detailed analysis and high-level insights, providing a holistic view of transparency practices.

Core Dimensions:

The ITI is organised around four key dimensions:

1. Enabling Environment: This dimension examines the national or sub-national conditions that support transparency, focusing on regulatory frameworks and digital

6 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

tools. It provides a snapshot of the overall climate for transparency in the infrastructure sector.

2. Capacities and Processes: Here, the ITI evaluates the internal workings of procuring entities, assessing their procedures and capabilities for managing and disclosing information.

3. Citizen Participation: This dimension measures the opportunities for public engagement and how effectively citizens can use the disclosed information. It recognises the crucial role of public involvement in ensuring transparency.

4. Information Disclosure: The final dimension assesses the quantity and quality of project data disclosed by procuring entities, measuring the practical output of transparency efforts.

Each of the four dimensions is divided into a series of components to allow for their comprehensive evaluation. The result is a four-level hierarchy: the dimensions are determined by variables, which are, in turn, shaped by sub-variables, which are derived from indicators (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. ITI hierarchy of ITI Score.

Figure 1: ITI Hierarchy

All the indicators are individually evaluated and scored. A set of weighted indicator scores then gives a sub-variable score; a set of weighted sub-variable scores gives a variable score; and a set of weighted variable scores provides a dimension with the score. A national or subnational ITI score is finally obtained from the weighted sum of the four-dimension scores.

Dimensions Dimension 1: Enabling environment Dimension 1 assesses national or sub-national conditions enabling transparency for the infrastructure sector considering the regulatory framework and centralised digital tools. It has

7 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

one variable, three sub-variables and 12 indicators. The complete list of indicators is provided in Annex 1. The variable and sub-variables of the dimension are:

● Legal framework and digital tools ○ Regulatory framework for public access to information ○ Transparency standards in the public infrastructure sector ○ National digital information tools.

All indicators of this dimension apply at the national or sub-national level and are measured once at the country or local level, irrespective of the number of procuring entities selected for evaluation. Its results provide feedback to strengthen the national or sub-national environment, not processes within institutions. The score for the dimension is obtained through the weighted sum of the underlying indicators.

The indicators in this dimension are evaluated using information from online sources such as websites containing national regulatory frameworks and information linked to the sector, particularly those focused on transparency, public procurement, public infrastructure and public finances.

Dimension 2: Capacities and processes

Dimension 2 assesses the soundness of procuring entities’ procedures and capacities to disclose data and information. It has two variables, five sub-variables and 25 indicators. The complete list of indicators is provided in Annex 1. The variables and sub-variables of the dimension are:

● Institutional capacities ○ Basic knowledge ○ Digital capacities

● Institutional processes ○ Procedures to Disclose Information ○ Enablers and barriers to the disclosure of information ○ Control over infrastructure projects disclosure.

All the indicators of this dimension evaluate procuring entities, not national or subnational conditions. The indicators are assessed once in the selected procuring entities. The dimension results offer feedback to strengthen capacities and processes at the PE level. The dimension score is obtained through the weighted sums of the underlying indicators for each PE.

The data required to evaluate the indicators from this dimension are captured by a survey that must be undertaken by a selected government officer at each procuring entity through either self-assessment or interview.

8 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

Dimension 3: Citizen participation

Dimension 3 evaluates the opportunities provided by PEs for citizen participation and how citizens can use the disclosed public information. It has one variable, two sub-variables and 12 indicators. The complete list of indicators is provided in Annex 1. The variable and subvariables of the dimension are:

● Participation practices ○ Participation opportunities ○ Use of information by citizens.

All the indicators of this dimension evaluate PEs. The indicators are evaluated once for each of the selected PEs. The results from this dimension offer feedback to strengthen a PEs citizen’s participation practices. The score for this dimension is obtained through the weighted sums of the underlying indicators for each PE.

The data required to evaluate the indicators from this dimension are captured by a survey (the same as for dimension 2) that a selected government officer at each PE must undertake through either self-assessment or interview.

Dimension 4: Information disclosure

Dimension 4 assesses the amount of project data and information disclosed by the PEs according to the CoST Infrastructure Data Standard or the Open Contracting for Infrastructure Data Standard. It has one variable, six sub-variables and 44 indicators. The complete list of indicators is provided in Annex 1. The variable and sub-variables of the dimension are:

● Disclosure practices ○ Project identification ○ Project preparation ○ Construction contract procurement ○ Supervision contract procurement ○ Construction contract implementation ○ Supervision contract implementation

All indicators of this dimension evaluate the infrastructure projects developed by each PE. The dimension results offer feedback to the selected PEs to strengthen their information disclosure. The overall dimension score is obtained by averaging the weighted sum of the underlying indicators for each project.

The indices in this dimension are evaluated using information from online sources, such as websites containing data on public infrastructure projects and public procurement and other websites showing information linked to these evaluation objects.

9 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

Weights

The Infrastructure Transparency Index (ITI) draws on four building blocks known as dimensions, namely:

1. Enabling environment (weight: 0.20)

2. Capacities and processes (weight: 0.25)

3. Citizen participation (weight: 0.20)

4. Information disclosure (weight: 0.35)

The weights assigned to each dimension reflect their relative importance in contributing to the overall Infrastructure Transparency Index score. These weights were determined through a collaborative process involving infrastructure transparency and governance experts.

The Enabling Environment dimension, with a weight of 0.20, assesses the national or subnational context and legal framework that support transparency in the infrastructure sector. This dimension is crucial as it sets the foundation for transparency practices at the institutional level.

Capacities and Processes, weighted at 0.25, evaluates the internal capabilities and procedures of procuring entities to disclose information. This dimension is given a slightly higher weight compared to the Enabling Environment, as it directly assesses the ability of entities to implement transparency measures.

Citizen Participation, with a weight of 0.20, measures the opportunities provided by procuring entities for public engagement and the use of disclosed information by citizens. This dimension is considered equally important as the Enabling Environment in promoting transparency and accountability.

Finally, the Information Disclosure dimension, with the highest weight of 0.35, assesses the actual disclosure of project data and information by procuring entities. This dimension is given the highest weight because it represents the tangible output of transparency efforts and is the most direct measure of transparency in practice.

The final ITI score for each procuring entity is calculated using a weighted sum of the scores obtained in each dimension. This approach ensures that the dimensions with higher weights, such as Information Disclosure and Capacities and Processes, have a greater impact on the overall ITI score, reflecting their importance in achieving infrastructure transparency.

Chapter 2 | Methodology

2.1 Evaluation process

The Infrastructure Transparency Index (ITI) employs a rigorous and tailored evaluation methodology for each of its four dimensions, building upon the framework outlined in Chapter 1. This section focuses on the specific processes and quality control measures implemented during the evaluation.

Quality Assurance Across Dimensions

While each dimension has its unique assessment approach, several overarching quality assurance principles are applied throughout the evaluation process:

1. Multiple Evaluator System: At least two independent evaluators assess each indicator for dimensions relying on desktop research (Enabling Environment and Information Disclosure). This system minimises individual bias and ensures consistency.

2. Conflict Resolution: In cases of disagreement between evaluators, a third evaluator is brought in to resolve discrepancies, ensuring a fair and balanced assessment.

3. Evidence-Based Evaluation: Across all dimensions, evaluators are required to provide evidence supporting their assessments, enhancing the credibility and traceability of the results.

4. Contextual Adaptation: While maintaining a standardised core, the evaluation process allows for some flexibility to accommodate local contexts and data availability, particularly in the Citizen Participation dimension.

Unique Aspects of Dimension 2 and 3 Evaluations

The survey-based approach for Capacities and Processes and Citizen Participation dimensions incorporates additional quality control measures:

1. Official Endorsement: The procuring entity officially appoints and endorses the responding officer, ensuring institutional backing for the provided information.

2. Expertise Requirement: The designated officer must have comprehensive knowledge of the entity's transparency practices and infrastructure projects.

3. Evaluation Team Review: The evaluation team critically reviews survey responses, cross-referencing with available evidence and potentially adjusting scores to ensure accuracy and consistency across entities.

Balancing Standardization and Flexibility

The ITI evaluation process strikes a balance between maintaining a standardized methodology for comparability and allowing enough flexibility to capture the nuances of different institutional and national contexts. This approach enables the ITI to provide a comprehensive and credible assessment of infrastructure transparency while remaining adaptable to diverse global settings.

11 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

This multifaceted approach made the ITI a powerful tool for identifying strengths and weaknesses in transparency practices, guiding policy reforms, and ultimately contributing to more accountable and effective infrastructure development as summarized in the table below.

The Infrastructure Transparency Index (ITI) employs a comprehensive data collection strategy, combining rigorous desktop research with targeted surveys of procuring entities. This approach ensures a thorough and multifaceted assessment of transparency in public infrastructure projects.

Desktop Research

For Dimensions 1 (Enabling Environment) and 4 (Information Disclosure), evaluators primarily relied on digital sources, following a hierarchical approach to data collection:

1. Government Procurement Portal (GPP): The primary source for procurement-related information.

2. Electronic Government Procurement (eGP) system: Consulted when data was not available on the GPP.

3. Individual Procuring Entity (PE) websites: Used to supplement and verify information from centralized portals.

4. Multi-lateral websites. This were used to validate and verify information as a means of obtaining accurate data.

Additional data was gathered from various government and regulatory body websites to provide context and cross-verification.

This reliance on official online sources ensures data credibility and reflects the growing importance of digital infrastructure in transparency initiatives. However, it may potentially overlook transparency efforts not captured in digital platforms, highlighting the need for comprehensive digital reporting systems.

12 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

Procuring entity survey

For Dimensions 2 (Capacities and Processes) and 3 (Citizen Participation), data was collected

through a mixed-method approach:

1. Self-assessment forms: Distributed to designated officers in each procuring entity.

2. Structured interviews: Conducted to clarify responses and gather additional insights.

This combination of methods balances the need for standardized data collection with the

benefits of direct engagement and contextual understanding. The flexibility in survey

methodology allows for adaptation to varying entity capacities and contexts, enhancing the

comprehensiveness of the data collected.

Figure 2: Shows the designations of officers that were engaged during the evaluation exercise.

Various entities appointed different officials as contact persons for the second ITI evaluation. In some cases, Accounting Officers personally completed the survey to ensure accuracy of information shared with the evaluators.

Data Collection Period

The data collection process consisted of two main components:

1. Procuring Entity Survey: April 15th to April 30th, 2024, Selected entities completed self-assessment forms on their transparency practices, capacities, processes, and citizen engagement efforts.

2. Infrastructure Project Evaluation: May 1st to May 28th, 2024. The evaluation team assessed sampled infrastructure projects based on publicly available information.

To accommodate varying response times from entities and ensure comprehensive data collection, the evaluation team extended the original deadline. This flexibility resulted in a higher number of completed survey forms and a more robust dataset for analysis.

The dual approach of entity surveys and project evaluations provided a comprehensive view of infrastructure transparency in Uganda, balancing self-reported institutional practices with objective assessments of public project information.

13 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

2.3 Procuring entities sample

The selection of Procuring Entities (PEs) for the ITI evaluation aimed to ensure a representative and comprehensive sample. The process utilized three key disclosure platforms: the Government Procurement Portal (GPP), the Electronic Government Procurement system, and individual PE websites. Additionally, information from multilateral financing banks was consulted.

Selection Process:

1. Initial Identification: An initial pool of 42 PEs across 12 sectors was identified based on their high budget allocations for infrastructure projects.

2. Selection Criteria:

o Budget Allocation: PEs with the highest allocations were prioritized.

o Sector Representation: The sample aimed to cover diverse sectors including transport, health, education, water, and energy.

3. Data Used:

o Procurement plans and reports from the GPP and e-GP o Budget allocation and expenditure information o Sector-specific data

Final Sample:

The final sample consisted of 30 PEs, collectively accounting for 73% of Uganda's infrastructure budget during the evaluation period. This diverse sample provides a comprehensive view of transparency practices across different types of projects and sectors.

By employing this systematic, data-driven approach to PE selection, the ITI evaluation team established a strong foundation for assessing infrastructure transparency in Uganda. The combination of high budget coverage and sector diversity enhances the reliability and usefulness of the ITI findings for driving improvements across the nation's infrastructure sector.

Data Used for Selection:

The selection process relied on a variety of data points:

1. Procurement Plans and Reports: Detailed plans and reports from the GPP and eGP

provided insights into the scale and scope of each PE's projects.

2. Budget Data: Information on budget allocations and expenditures helped identify

high-impact PEs.

3. Sector Data: Sector-specific information ensured a balanced representation across

different areas of infrastructure development.

14 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

Final Sample and Coverage:

The final sample consisted of 30 PEs, which collectively accounted for 80% of the selected PEs infrastructure budget during the evaluation period. This high coverage ensures that the ITI results are representative of the overall state of infrastructure transparency in the country.

Moreover, the diversity of sectors represented in the sample allows for insights into transparency practices across different types of projects, from road construction to healthcare facility upgrades.

By employing a systematic, data-driven approach to PE selection, the ITI evaluation team has laid a strong foundation for a comprehensive and meaningful assessment of infrastructure transparency in Uganda. The combination of high budget coverage and sector diversity in the sample enhances the reliability and usefulness of the ITI findings for driving improvements in transparency practices across the nation's infrastructure sector.

2.4 Infrastructure project sample

The selection of infrastructure projects for the second ITI evaluation in Uganda aimed to provide a representative and comprehensive view of transparency practices across the 30 selected procuring entities (PEs). The process involved a systematic approach to ensure the inclusion of projects with varying characteristics, such as budget size, type, completion status, and geographical location. Ten (10) infrastructure entities from first Index were included in the second Index to ascertain progress being made toward disclosure best practices. Their comparison is done at the end of this report. New infrastructure projects were assessed in these ten PEs included in the second ITI Index from the first Index.

Initial Identification:

The evaluation team began by extracting a pool of 447 infrastructure projects from the Government Procurement Portal (GPP) for the period under review (2019-2024). Additionally, each PE provided a list of their active and recently completed projects through self-assessment forms and interviews.

Selection Criteria:

From this initial pool, two projects were selected for each PE based on the following criteria:

20 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

1. Budget Size: To capture a range of financial magnitudes, the sample included both small and large-scale projects. For PEs with only one high-value project, that project was automatically selected. For PEs with multiple projects, the second project was randomly chosen from the remaining pool.

2. Project Type: The sample aimed to cover a diverse array of project types across sectors such as transport, health, education, energy, water, and sanitation. This ensured a broad representation of different infrastructure domains.

3. Completion Status: Both ongoing and recently completed projects were included to assess transparency practices throughout the project lifecycle.

4. Geographical Coverage: Projects were selected from various regions within Uganda to account for potential regional variations in transparency and project management.

5. Randomization: For PEs without two high-value projects, the second project was randomly selected from the remaining pool. If a PE had no high-value projects, another entity from the same sector was chosen to maintain sectoral representation.

Data Used for Selection:

The selection process drew upon multiple data sources:

1. Self-Assessment Forms and Interviews: These provided detailed project information, including descriptions, budgets, timelines, and challenges.

2. Government Procurement Portal (GPP): The GPP offered comprehensive data on procurement plans, tender notices, contract awards, and project implementation status.

3. Electronic Government Procurement (eGP) System: This system provided insights into procurement processes, transparency compliance, and financial management.

4. PE Websites: Additional project details, progress reports, and performance assessments were obtained from individual PE websites.

Time Frame and Coverage:

The evaluation considered projects initiated and completed between 2019 and 2024. This fiveyear window captured a period of significant infrastructure development in Uganda and allowed for the assessment of both older and more recent projects, providing a comprehensive view of how transparency practices have evolved over time.

The final sample consisted of 58 projects from 30 PEs, with two entities having only one project each and there were no other infrastructure projects within the sub sector and methodology do not allow picking from other sector. While the original target was 60 projects, this slight deviation does not significantly impact the representativeness of the sample, as it still covers a substantial portion of the PEs' project portfolios.

21 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

It is important to note that while this sampling approach provides a diverse range of projects, it may not be fully representative of all infrastructure projects in Uganda during the period, however, it does provide a global measure for transparency in the delivery of public infrastructure projects in the country. However, the inclusion of both ongoing and completed projects allows for assessment across different project stages, which is crucial given the observed decline in transparency throughout the project lifecycle.

By employing a rigorous, multi-criteria selection process and leveraging various data sources, the ITI evaluation has compiled a robust and representative sample of infrastructure projects. This sample forms the foundation for a comprehensive assessment of transparency practices across Uganda's infrastructure sector, enabling the identification of strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

2.5 Interaction protocol

The engagement with Procuring Entities (PEs) throughout the ITI evaluation process followed a structured and iterative approach to ensure comprehensive data collection and maintain open lines of communication. The interaction protocol was designed to guide PEs through the assessment process, provide support and clarification, and handle any challenges that arose.

The process consisted of the following key stages (see Table 3 for a summary):

1. Invitation and Initial Contact:

The evaluation team sent formal invitation letters to all selected PEs, outlining the purpose and scope of the ITI assessment. Follow-up calls were made to confirm receipt of the invitations and address any initial questions or concerns.

2. Distribution of Self-Assessment Forms:

Self-assessment forms were emailed to the designated contact persons at each PE, along with detailed guidance materials, instructions, and examples to facilitate accurate and complete responses.

3. Ongoing Support and Communication:

27 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

Throughout the data collection period, the evaluation team provided a dedicated helpdesk to offer technical assistance and answer any queries from the PEs.

Weekly check-in calls were conducted to monitor progress, identify potential issues, and provide timely support.

4. Structured Interviews:

In cases where further clarification or in-depth discussions were necessary, the team scheduled structured interviews with key officials at the PEs. These interviews aimed to gather additional insights and ensure a comprehensive understanding of the PEs' transparency practices.

5. Handling Delays and Non-Responses:

To address delays in form completion and submission, the evaluation team sent reminder notices to the PEs and, where necessary, escalated the matter to higher authorities within the entities and in some instance the accounting officers filled the survey form themselves. In cases of persistent non-response, the team considered substituting the unresponsive contact persons with alternative person from the same entity to maintain the representativeness of the sample.

6. Completion and Submission:

Upon receiving the completed self-assessment forms and conducting all necessary interviews, the evaluation team performed a final review of the collected data. Submission confirmations were sent to the PEs.

Table 5: Shows the interaction protocol used to engage the PEs and the stages of evaluation process.

Table 6: Shows the different steps taken to engage the stakeholders in the selection of the

Procuring Entities to participate in the 2nd ITI exercise.

Step1: Selection of the assessment methodology.

The evaluation team conducted an online interview after sharing the survey form via emails and WhatsApp to contact persons from the entities. A follow up visit was done by CoST Manager to selected entities.:

Step3 A press release issued.

The CoST National Secretariat issued three press releases. First to create awareness about the exercise, secondly to inform the entities on the extension of the data collection dates and third one to notify entities of the closed up of the data collection and standard communication protocol were used

Step5: Follow ups by evaluators.

The evaluators consistently follow up on the contact persons for all the entities on emails, phone calls, and WhatsApp messages to support and interest them to fill the survey form and return.

Step7: Development of the dashboard.

To ease analysis, presentation and interpretation of the results. All data collected was entered into the results sharing dashboard that also served as the online repository for data submitted for analysis.

Step9: Peer review of the draft report The draft report developed was reviewed by different by ITI team, ITI Expert and CoST IS Meal Manager among others.

Step2: Presentation of ITI Process to stakeholder. (Commissioning event) CoST Uganda Secretariat in partnership with the Ministry of Works and Transport and Host Organization (AFIC) organized a commissioning event on 11/4/2024 and presented the ITI process and PEs selected to participate in the exercise.

Step4: Self-Assessment done.

All the selected PEs received an official letter for participation in the exercise, and an introductory letter from the PS Ministry of Works and Transport was shared to all accounting Officers of the selected entities.

Step 6: Check-In-calls.

To monitor the progress in the data collection process, 6 check-in-calls were done, and important decisions taken to ensure that entities comply in filling the survey form.

Step8: Report drafting.

The report was produced based on the data analysed, presented and interpreted by the third evaluator and open data specialist. The report was reviewed by a third and fourth eye to ensure conformity with the reporting standard for ITI.

Step10: Final inputs incorporated.

Once the index findings are announced, inputs from the stakeholders including the entities that participated in the index will be

29 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

received and incorporated in the ITI report and published in the CoST website for public consumption.

Step11: Dissemination and validation of the findings.

The announcement of the 2nd ITI index shall be done in an engagement baraza which will be attended by all the entities that participated in the 2nd ITI, invited stakeholders in the infrastructure sector and the media.

Step 12: Media engagements A media engagement was organized to popularize the finding and recommendations to stimulate debates and actions from duty bearers.

Despite all the communications made to all entities, the following entities could not complete their survey forms and return to the evaluation team within the evaluation time frame even when the dates were extended. And yet different communication methods were used to encourage them to complete the exercise. These entities were; -

1. Ministry of Water and Environment

2. Ministry of Local Government

3. Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives

4. Ministry of Education and Sports

5. Ministry of Health

6. Uganda Electricity Distribution Company Limited

7. Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited

8. National Social Security Fund

9. Makerere University

10. Kamuli District Local Government

11. Pakwach District Local Government

The non-participation of these entities, while unfortunate, does not significantly detract from the overall representativeness and value of the ITI evaluation, given the comprehensive engagement with most selected PEs. The insights gained from the participating entities provide a robust foundation for assessing and improving infrastructure transparency in Uganda.

2.6 Challenges and limitations

The ITI evaluation process in Uganda encountered several challenges and limitations that highlight systemic issues in data management and transparency practices across government entities. These can be categorized as follows:

1. Data Collection and Management Challenges:

o

Incomplete registration of entities in the Government Procurement Portal (GPP)

30 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

o

o

Mixed project data in procurement portals, making it time-consuming to isolate relevant information Scant project data, often insufficient and not aligned with the Infrastructure Data Standard (IDS) and Open Contracting for Infrastructure Data Standard (OC4IDS)

2. Entity Engagement and Responsiveness:

o Varying levels of engagement, with many citing busy schedules as a reason for delayed responses o Negative attitudes from some entities, exemplified by remarks such as "I'm filling this out because you are insisting" or "you people, Hehe" o Long procedures and bureaucracy in delegating tasks, causing delays and non-responses to the self-assessment survey

3. Technical and Capacity Issues:

o Limited understanding of transparency standards among officials o Difficulties in completing the survey, particularly when contact persons were not project managers for the evaluated projects o Inactive official email accounts, potentially leading to loss of institutional memory and confidentiality risks

4. Time Constraints:

o The assessment coincided with the third and fourth quarters of the financial year, a busy period for government entities Limitations:

1. Data Availability: Limited disclosure of infrastructure project data on public platforms, particularly in less digitally advanced entities, affected the comprehensiveness of the assessment.

2. Time Constraints: The busy period during which the assessment was conducted may have affected the quality of responses from entities.

These challenges underscore the need for broader capacity building in transparency practices and improved data management across government entities, preferably using open data formats and platforms. They also highlight the importance of standardized disclosure practices and the potential value of tools like the IDS and OC4IDS.

To strengthen future ITI evaluations, considerations should be given to:

1. Enhancing digital infrastructure for transparency across all entities

31 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

2. Standardizing data disclosure practices to improve consistency and comparability

3. Expanding capacity-building efforts to address knowledge gaps among officials

4. Exploring ways to incorporate more direct citizen feedback in the assessment process

5. Timing the assessment to avoid peak periods in the government financial calendar

By addressing these challenges and limitations, Uganda can work towards a more comprehensive and accurate picture of infrastructure transparency, ultimately leading to improved practices and outcomes in the sector.

Observations

These delays affected the quality of information that was shared which had implications to stakeholders in the infrastructure sector implementation. Therefore, in the absence of a third eye from the stakeholders, it gives opportunities for corrupt practices or mismanagement of implementation processes to occur. Consequently, that will have a bearing on the quality of infrastructure projects delivered. Efficiency will be compromised and that may increase public spending. But if there is timely information sharing in an accessible manner then the above issues will be addressed in time because of the participation from the stakeholders.

Adherence to protocol and procedures is critical in the management of information sharing for public consumption by PEs.

has an impact on the timeliness and that may defeat the purpose for which such information is required, to harness stakeholders’ participation in the infrastructure project implementation to enhance the desired impact. For this assessment it had implications on the entity’s performance in all dimensions which is evaluated.

These responses indicate limited information sharing for public usage and it does not conform to the provisions of Access to Information Act 2005 and the PPDA Act (as amended 2021). If information sharing is limited, then stakeholders’ participation in public procurement and implementation of infrastructure project delivery. This means infrastructure delivery will be prone to poor quality, ineffectiveness, inefficiency due corrupt tendencies, mismanagement and wastages.

Limited awareness about the CoST Programme by some PEs could have affected response levels. Especially for entities that have not interfaced with the CoST programme including attending the commissioning of the 2 nd ITI event.

Chapter 3 | Results

3.1 National ITI score

The Infrastructure Transparency Index (ITI) 2024 Uganda Report presents a comprehensive assessment of the country's progress in enhancing transparency in the public infrastructure sector. The national ITI score is a key benchmark, providing an overall measure of Uganda's performance across four critical dimensions: enabling environment, capacities and processes, citizen participation, and information disclosure.

Figure 4 presents Uganda's national ITI score for 2024, along with the scores for each of the four dimensions. The overall national ITI score stands at 32.26%, marking an improvement from the 2021 score which stood at 20.8% and not really a significant as it is still way below average. This 11.46 percentage point increase demonstrates Uganda's commitment to advancing transparency in the infrastructure sector and highlights the progress made since the previous assessment, but not necessarily the best performance as Uganda still ranks 3rd  last with Indonesia among the 9 countries that have adopted this measure of transparency.

Figure 3: Shows the general results from the national score and the dimensions.

Despite this improvement, the 2024 national ITI score also underscores the substantial work that remains to achieve optimal levels of transparency. With scores ranging from 26.81% to 43.50% across the four dimensions, it is evident that Uganda still faces significant challenges in fully implementing transparency practices in the infrastructure sector.

The enabling environment dimension, which assesses the legal and regulatory framework for transparency, received the highest score at 43.50%, this provides the legal backing for

34 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

infrastructure transparency advocacy in the country. These findings, however, suggests that Uganda will need to make more efforts to realize the much-needed progress in establishing a conducive policy environment for transparency, and opening up public infrastructure delivery to public scrutiny. However, the lower scores in the other dimensions indicate that translating these policies into effective practices remains challenging.

The capacities and processes dimension, which evaluates procuring entities' abilities and procedures to disclose information, received a score of 29.78%. While this represents an improvement from the previous assessment, it highlights the need for further capacity building and institutional strengthening to ensure that procuring entities can effectively implement transparency measures.

Citizen participation, which assesses the opportunities for public engagement and the use of disclosed information, received a score of 33.65%. This improvement indicates that Uganda is progressing in creating avenues for citizen involvement in the infrastructure sector. However, there is still significant room for growth in this area, particularly in terms of making disclosed information more accessible and user-friendly for citizens.

The information disclosure dimension, which examines the actual publication of project-related data, received the lowest score at 26.81%. This underscores the need for procuring entities to prioritise the timely and comprehensive disclosure of project information throughout the project lifecycle. Improving information disclosure practices is critical for enabling effective public oversight and accountability in the infrastructure sector.

3.1.1 International comparison

To contextualise Uganda's performance, the ITI 2024 Uganda Report also includes an international comparison, benchmarking Uganda's ITI scores against those of other countries. This comparison provides valuable insights into Uganda's relative progress and highlights areas where the country can learn from international best practices.

Figure 8 compares Uganda's national ITI score with that of Costa Rica, both from their respective second ITI assessments. Uganda's score of 32.26% represents a significant improvement from its previous assessment, narrowing the gap with Costa Rica's score of 47%. However, the comparison also underscores the substantial progress that Uganda still needs to make to catch up with leading performers in infrastructure transparency.

Table 8: National ITI Score Comparison Country National ITI Score (%) Uganda 32.26 Costa Rica 47.00

35 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

Figure 9 delves deeper into the international comparison, presenting Uganda's scores for each ITI dimension alongside those of Costa Rica. Uganda is compared with Costa Rica because of the long experience Costa Rica has in doing successful ITI and Uganda can borrow a lift to improve on her experience in conducting ITI after drawing lesson. This analysis reveals that Uganda outperforms Costa Rica in the enabling environment dimension, suggesting that Uganda has made significant strides in establishing a strong legal and regulatory framework for transparency. However, Costa Rica's higher scores in the capacities and processes and citizen participation dimensions indicate that Uganda can learn from Costa Rica's experiences in building institutional capacity and engaging citizens in the infrastructure sector.

At the forefront of transparency efforts stands the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA),

which has set a new benchmark for transparency in Uganda's public sector. With an

impressive overall score of 80.26%, KCCA demonstrates that high levels of transparency are

achievable and can be consistently maintained across various aspects of infrastructure project

management. Their performance is particularly noteworthy in:

1. Citizen participation (92.85%)

2. Capacities and processes (87.16%)

3. Information disclosure (66.35%)

41 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

This well-rounded approach to transparency could serve as a model for other entities to learn and replicate.

Following KCCA, but with a considerable gap, is the Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT), securing the second position with a score of 60.66%. The Office of the President rounds out the top three with a score of 55.23%, notably excelling in citizen participation (91.20%) but struggling considerably with information disclosure (8.88%). This significant drop in scores from the top performer underscores the challenges faced by the otherwise presumably wellresourced central government entities in implementing comprehensive transparency measures.

Figure 9 above shows the performance of the best three entities (KCCA, MoWT and Office of the President) arose from their willingness to disclose information and the will and abilities to remove internal barriers. The performance disparity becomes even more pronounced when examining the broader spectrum of evaluated entities. Only three out of the thirty assessed procuring entities scored above the 50% mark, a stark indication of the systemic challenges pervading transparency practices across Uganda's public infrastructure sector. A quartile analysis of the scores further illuminates this trend:

43 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

To provide a more nuanced understanding of the distribution of transparency performance across procuring entities, we conducted a quartile analysis. This analysis reveals significant disparities in performance:

3. Q3 (Third Quartile, 8 entities): Average Score: 20.99%

4. Q4 (Bottom Quartile, 7 entities): Average Score: 7.09%

This distribution aligns with our earlier observation that only three out of the thirty assessed procuring entities scored above the 50% mark. The top quartile, while performing better than the rest, still has significant room for improvement with an average score just above 50%.

The stark contrast between the top and bottom quartiles (55.53% vs. 7.09%) underscores the wide performance gap among procuring entities. This disparity suggests that while some entities have made substantial progress in implementing transparency measures, many others are still at the early stages of this journey.

The second and third quartiles, with average scores of 36.62% and 20.99% respectively, represent the majority of entities that are making progress but still face significant challenges in fully implementing transparency practices.

This quartile analysis highlights the need for targeted interventions, particularly for entities in the lower quartiles, and the potential for peer learning from top-performing entities to elevate overall transparency standards in Uganda's public infrastructure sector.

3.3.1 Results by Procuring Entities Budget

The analysis of Infrastructure Transparency Index (ITI) scores in relation to procuring entities' budget sizes reveals a striking correlation between financial resources and transparency performance. To better understand this relationship, procuring entities were grouped into five budget categories based on their allocated budgets in trillions of Ugandan Shillings (UGX). The budget ranges were determined by analyzing the distribution of procuring entities' budgets and identifying natural breakpoints that would result in meaningful and comparable groups.

The five budget groups are as follows:

1. 0-2 trillion UGX

2. 2-4 trillion UGX

3. 4-6 trillion UGX

4. 6-8 trillion UGX

8-12 trillion UGX

These ranges were chosen to provide a balanced representation of the procuring entities' budgets, with each group containing a sufficient number of entities to allow for meaningful comparisons. The lower range (0-2 trillion UGX) captures entities with smaller budgets, while the higher range (8-12 trillion UGX) represents entities with the largest budgets. The intermediate ranges (2-4, 4-6, and 6-8 trillion UGX) provide a more granular breakdown of the budget distribution.

By grouping procuring entities into these budget ranges, we can better understand how financial resources influence transparency performance and identify potential trends or patterns. This analysis helps policymakers and stakeholders target their efforts and resources towards entities that may require additional support to improve their transparency practices.

Figure 15 presents the average ITI score for each budget group, revealing a clear trend: as the budget size increases, the average ITI score rises correspondingly. Entities with budgets in the 8-12 trillion UGX range achieved the highest average score of 80.26%, while those in the 0-2 trillion UGX category have the lowest average score of 36.23%.

.

This clear positive correlation between budget size and ITI scores suggests that procuring entities with larger budgets tend to have better transparency practices. Several factors could contribute to this trend:

1. Donor funded projects: Most infrastructure project financed by donors are more transparent than government of Uganda funded projects. Projects data information are disclosed in both government and donor digital platforms and websites. Government needs to adopt this good practices.

2. Resource Availability: Larger budgets may allow entities to allocate more resources specifically to transparency initiatives, such as implementing digital disclosure systems or hiring dedicated transparency officers.

3. Institutional Capacity: Entities with larger budgets often have more staff and betterdeveloped institutional structures, which can facilitate the implementation of comprehensive transparency measures.

4. Scrutiny and Accountability: Higher-budget entities may face greater public and regulatory scrutiny, incentivizing them to maintain higher standards of transparency.

5. Project Complexity: Larger budgets often correlate with more complex projects, which may require more sophisticated project management and reporting systems that inherently support better transparency.

6. Technology Adoption: Entities with larger budgets may be better positioned to invest in advanced technologies that facilitate data collection, management, and disclosure.

However, it's important to note that the relationship between budget size and transparency performance is not perfect. Some entities in lower budget categories outperform their peers, demonstrating that effective transparency practices are achievable even with limited resources. This suggests that factors beyond just financial resources, such as leadership commitment, organizational culture, and efficient resource utilization, play crucial roles in determining transparency outcomes.

The performance gap between the highest and lowest budget groups (a difference of 44.03 percentage points) highlights the need for targeted interventions to support lower-budget entities in improving their transparency practices. These could include:

1. Developing cost-effective transparency tools and guidelines tailored for entities with limited resources.

2. Implementing mentorship programs where high-performing, high-budget entities support lower-budget entities through peer learnings.

3. Prioritizing capacity building and training for lower-budget entities.

4. Exploring shared service models for transparency-related functions to help subnational entities access advanced tools and expertise.

5. Strengthening information disclosure and monitoring using the data dashboard for timely identify red flags and redress of the gaps.

46 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

By addressing these budget-related disparities while also recognizing and learning from outperforming lower-budget entities, Uganda can work towards a more equitable and consistently transparent infrastructure sector, regardless of entity size or budget.

3.3.2 Results by procuring entities type

The Infrastructure Transparency Index (ITI) 2024 Uganda also examined transparency performance across different types of procuring entities to identify potential variations and patterns. Procuring entities were classified into three main categories: Central Government, Agencies nd Local Government. This classification reflects the different levels of governance and administrative structures within the Ugandan public sector.

Central Government entities are those that operate at the national level and are typically responsible for large-scale infrastructure projects with wider geographic coverage. These entities often have larger budgets and more specialized technical expertise compared to their local counterparts. Examples of Central Government entities include ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) such as the Ministry of Works and Transport, and Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, among others have more opportunities to win donor support.

On the other hand, Local Government entities operate at the subnational level, such as districts, municipalities, and sub-counties. These entities are responsible for infrastructure projects within their respective jurisdictions and often have smaller budgets and more limited technical capacities compared to central government entities. Local Government entities play a crucial role in delivering infrastructure services to communities and ensuring that projects meet local needs and priorities.

By disaggregating the ITI results by procuring entity type, the report aims to identify any systematic differences in transparency performance between Central and Local Government entities. This analysis can help policymakers and stakeholders understand the unique challenges and opportunities faced by each type of entity and design targeted interventions to improve transparency practices.

Figure 11 presents the average ITI scores for Central and Local Government entities, revealing a notable performance gap. Central Government entities achieved an average score of 30.53%, while Local Government entities scored an average of 25.82%. These results represent an improvement from the 2021 ITI assessment, where Central Government entities scored 15.22%, and Local Government entities uniformly scored 15%.

Figure 11: Shows the average performance of entities by type category (Central and Local Government).

47 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

The improved performance of both Central and Local Government entities in 2024 compared to 2021 suggests that continued efforts to promote transparency could yield positive results across all levels of government. However, the persistence of a performance gap between the two entity types indicates that Local Government entities may still face additional challenges in implementing transparency measures effectively.

Several factors could contribute to this performance gap, such as differences in institutional capacity, resource availability, and technical expertise between Central and Local Government entities. Additionally, the varying scales and complexities of infrastructure projects managed by each entity type may influence their ability to maintain consistent transparency practices.

Despite the performance gap, the improvements observed in both entity types underscore the potential for progress and the importance of continued efforts to strengthen transparency practices at all levels of government. Policymakers and stakeholders can use these findings to prioritize capacity-building initiatives and resource allocation to support Local Government entities in enhancing their transparency performance.

48 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

Furthermore, the relatively smaller performance gap between Central and Local Government entities in 2024 compared to 2021 suggests that decentralization efforts may be contributing to improved local governance capacities. This highlights the importance of continued support for decentralization initiatives and knowledge-sharing between different levels of government to promote best practices in infrastructure transparency.

3.3.3 Results by Procuring Entities Sector

In addition to analysing transparency performance by procuring entity type, the Infrastructure Transparency Index (ITI) 2024 Uganda Report also examines results across different sectors to identify sector-specific trends and challenges. Procuring entities were categorised into various sectors based on their primary areas of operation and the types of infrastructure projects they undertake. The sectors considered in the analysis include Agriculture, Works and Transport, Water, Central Government, Health, Local Governments, Education, and Trade and Industry.

Examining transparency performance by sector is crucial for understanding how different areas of the economy and public service delivery are faring in terms of openness and accountability. Each sector has unique characteristics, stakeholder demands, and regulatory frameworks that can influence transparency practices. By disaggregating the ITI results by sector, policymakers and stakeholders can identify sector-specific strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement.

Figure 12 presents the average ITI scores for each sector, revealing significant variations in transparency performance. The agriculture sector emerged as the top performer, with an average score of 46.63%, followed closely by the Works and Transport sector at 43.15% due to more opportunities of donor funded projects. On the other hand, the Education and Trade and Industry sectors have the lowest average scores at 14.25% and 4.99%, respectively had more government funded projects.

49 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

The agriculture sector emerged as the top performer with an average score of 46.63%, followed closely by the Works and Transport sector at 43.15%. This performance can be attributed to several factors:

1. Historical focus: Both sectors have historically been priority areas for development in Uganda, attracting significant donor funding and scrutiny. This attention has likely led to more robust transparency practices over time.

2. Project scale: These sectors often involve large-scale, high-visibility projects that naturally attract more public and media attention, necessitating greater transparency.

3. Regulatory environment: The agriculture and transport sectors in Uganda have undergone significant regulatory reforms in recent years, which may have included stronger transparency requirements.

The Water sector's performance (35.57%) is noteworthy, falling in the middle range. This could reflect the sector's unique challenges, such as the involvement of both public and private entities in service delivery, which can complicate transparency efforts.

At the lower end of the spectrum, we find the Education (14.25%), Trade and Industry (4.99%) sectors. Several factors might contribute to their poor performance:

1. Resource constraints: These sectors might have fewer resources allocated to transparency initiatives compared to higher-performing sectors.

2. Capacity issues: There may be a lack of specialized personnel or training in transparency practices within these sectors.

3. Project nature: Education and Trade projects might involve smaller, more numerous initiatives that are harder to track and report on consistently.

4. Sector priorities: These sectors may have prioritized other aspects of project delivery over transparency, possibly due to immediate service delivery pressures.

The significant performance gap between the highest and lowest-scoring sectors (over 40 percentage points) underscores the need for sector-specific strategies to improve transparency. High-performing sectors like Agriculture broadly under the Agro-industrialization programme and Works and Transport broadly under the Integrated Transport infrastructure and services programme. These could serve as models, sharing best practices and lessons learned with lower-performing sectors which fall under the public sector transformation and Human Capital development.

To address these disparities, policymakers should consider:

50 Infrastructure Transparency Index 2024 Uganda Report

1. Conducting sector-specific transparency audits to identify unique challenges and opportunities.

2. Developing targeted capacity-building programs for lower-performing sectors.

3. Establishing cross-sector learning initiatives to share best practices.

4. Reviewing and aligning sector-specific regulations to ensure consistent transparency requirements across all sectors.

By addressing these sector-specific challenges and leveraging successful practices from highperforming sectors, Uganda can work towards a more uniformly transparent and accountable infrastructure landscape across all sectors.

3.3.4 Sub-rankings

To provide a more granular analysis of transparency performance, the ITI 2024 Uganda also presents sub-rankings for procuring entities based on their type and performance across individual ITI dimensions. These sub-rankings offer insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of different procuring entities and highlight areas where targeted interventions may be most effective.

Figure 19 presents the top-performing procuring entities within each entity type (i.e., Central Government and Local Government). This sub-ranking allows for a direct comparison of transparency performance among peers and identifies entities that can serve as role models or benchmarks within their respective categories.

By identifying the leaders in each dimension, policymakers and stakeholders can better understand the factors contributing to strong transparency performance. For example, the Office of the President's high score in the citizen participation dimension (Dimension 3) suggests that this entity has established effective mechanisms for engaging citizens and incorporating their feedback into decision-making processes.

The sub-rankings provide valuable insights into procuring entities' relative performance and help identify best practices that can be replicated across the public infrastructure sector. By learning from the successes of top-performing entities, policymakers and practitioners can develop targeted interventions and capacity-building initiatives to support other entities in enhancing their transparency practices.

Moreover, the sub-rankings underscore the importance of a multi-dimensional approach to transparency. While some entities may excel in certain aspects of transparency, such as citizen participation, they may need help in other areas, such as information disclosure. This highlights the need for comprehensive strategies that address all dimensions of transparency to achieve optimal outcomes.

3.4 Infrastructure projects scores

The ITI 2024 Uganda Report also assessed the transparency performance of individual infrastructure projects to provide a more detailed understanding of how transparency practices are implemented at the project level. By examining project-specific scores, policymakers and stakeholders can identify trends, challenges, and best practices that can inform the design and management of future infrastructure projects.

Table 9 presents the top 10 infrastructure projects based on their ITI scores and the corresponding procuring entities responsible for each project. This ranking highlights the
